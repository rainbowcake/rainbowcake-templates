### Architecture templates

This repository contains templates to easily create new screens in an application.

#### Installation

Download the contents of this repository, and copy the *ArchitectureScreenTemplate* folder to the following path:

```
<YOUR_INSTALL_PATH>\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\other
```

For example, on Windows, this might be here by default:

In the wizard that appears, enter: 
- the name of the screen you wish to create in UpperCamelCase (but without any suffixes, no "`Fragment`", etc.)
- the desired ViewState type for this screen (more info [here](https://gitlab.autsoft.hu/AutSoft/AndroidChapter/rainbow-cake/rainbow-cake-guide#view-states))
- whether you'll want to pass arguments to the screen (a `Long` ID argument will be generated by default, as well as supporting code, such as a `newInstance` method)
