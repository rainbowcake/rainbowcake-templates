# Architecture templates

This repository contains templates to generate boilerplate code for an Android application.

## Screen template

Creates a new screen: Fragment, ViewModel, View state, and Presenter.

### Installation

##### Basic installation

Download the contents of this repository, and copy the `RainbowCakeScreenTemplate` folder to the following path:

```
<YOUR_INSTALL_PATH>\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\other
```

For example, on Windows, this might be here by default:

```
C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\other
```

This does have the issue of having to be removed during Android Studio updates, which can be solved by the other installation mode instead:

##### Git cloned installation

Clone the repository into your `<user>/.android/templates/other` directory, like such:

```
cd ~/.android/templates/other
git clone [template repository path].git .
```

Then simply pull any updates to the templates via git:

```
git pull
```

### Usage

Right click either on the `ui` package or any nested package inside the `ui` package. Choose `New -> Other -> RainbowCake screen`.

In the wizard that appears, enter: 
- the name of the screen you wish to create in UpperCamelCase (but without any suffixes, no "`Fragment`", etc.)
- the desired ViewState type for this screen (more info [here](https://gitlab.autsoft.hu/AutSoft/AndroidChapter/rainbow-cake/rainbow-cake-guide#view-states))
- whether you'll want to pass arguments to the screen (a `Long` ID argument will be generated by default, as well as supporting code, such as a `newInstance` method)

Click `Finish` to create the screen, and add the created files to Git:
